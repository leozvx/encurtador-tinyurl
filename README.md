# TinyURL Shortener

This project is a simple TinyURL Shortener.

## Setup

First you need to [download](https://github.com/leozvx/encurtador-tinyurl/tree/download) the .zip.

` nodeRange node16 & node18 `

Open the `app.js` in vscode and install the dependencies:


```sh
 npm install axios
```



In the code you need to change your API token:

```js
const TinyAPI = "YOUR TOKEN"
```

After that create a `links.txt`

The last step is open the script.bat and will generate a randomic.txt with the result.
